    "context": "A 29-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by a concerned neighbor. The patient appears disheveled, has a flat affect, and appears to be having auditory hallucinations. He is alert and oriented to time, person, and place and has an intact long-term and short-term memory. His neighbor says that he never really knew the patient that well and that he mostly kept to himself. They have been neighbors for the past 3 years at an apartment close to the hospital. What worried the neighbor was a sudden change in the patient's behavior which started last week. He suddenly seemed interested in attending all the local council meetings and social gatherings. He is very talkative at these events and boasts highly of himself and starts suggesting changes that the committee could make with his help. He gets very agitated when they deny accepting his suggestions.",
    "query": "Which of the following is a predictor of good prognosis for this patient's condition?\n\nA. Affective symptoms\nB. Being single\nC. Male sex\nD. Negative symptoms",
    "answer_letter": "A",
    "question_idx": 1209,
    "response": "The patient described is exhibiting symptoms of schizophrenia, which is characterized by a range of symptoms including hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, and disorganized or catatonic behavior. The prognosis for schizophrenia can be influenced by several factors, including the presence of positive or negative symptoms, the age of onset, the severity of the symptoms, and the patient's response to treatment.\n\nA. Affective symptoms are those that involve mood changes, such as depression or mania. In the context of schizophrenia, affective symptoms can be a predictor of a good prognosis because they are more responsive to treatment and are less likely to be chronic.\n\nB. Being single is not a predictor of prognosis in schizophrenia. While social support can be beneficial, it is not a direct predictor of the course of the illness.\n\nC. Male sex is not a predictor of prognosis in schizophrenia. Gender is not a direct predictor of the course of the illness.\n\nD. Negative symptoms, such as flat affect, avolition, and anhedonia, are generally associated with a poorer prognosis in schizophrenia. These symptoms are less responsive to treatment and are more likely to be chronic.\n\nGiven the information provided, the patient's affective symptoms (A) are a predictor of a good prognosis because they are more responsive to treatment and less likely to be chronic. Therefore, affective symptoms are a positive predictor of a good prognosis in schizophrenia.\n\nSo, the answer is A.<|end_of_text|>",

Natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity is a part of the innate immune system and does not directly affect the production of high-affinity antibodies.\n\nC. Isotype switching in B cell maturation is a process that occurs after antigen stimulation and is essential for the production of different classes of antibodies (IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE). During a secondary immune response, isotype switching allows B cells to produce high-affinity antibodies that are more effective at neutralizing pathogens.\n\nD. Positive selection of T cells in the thymus is a process that ensures that T cells can recognize self-MHC molecules, but it does not directly impact the production of high-affinity antibodies during a secondary immune response.\n\nGiven that the patient has low immunoglobulin levels and a defect in producing high-affinity antibodies during a secondary immune response, the process that is likely compromised is isotype switching in B cell maturation.\n\nSo, the answer is C."

The pituitary gland is responsible for the production of several hormones, including prolactin, which is essential for lactation, as well as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol.\n\nThe symptoms of Sheehan's syndrome can vary, but common features include an inability to breastfeed (due to low prolactin levels), fatigue, amenorrhea, and signs of adrenal insufficiency (due to low ACTH and cortisol levels). An expanded sella turcica on MRI might be seen in long-standing cases, but it is not specific to Sheehan's syndrome and does not correlate with acute symptoms. Persistent hypernatremia could be a sign of diabetes insipidus, which can also occur with pituitary damage, but it is not specific to Sheehan's syndrome and does not correlate directly with lactation failure.\n\nGiven the options provided, diminished serum ACTH and cortisol levels, coupled with clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency, would be most indicative of Sheehan's syndrome. This would explain the patient's inability to lactate (due to low prolactin) and the hypoglycemia (due to cortisol deficiency), which is consistent with the pituitary damage that occurs in Sheehan's syndrome.\n\nSo, the answer is C."

For a typical adult weighing 70 kg, this would equate to 35 mL/hr. However, in the setting of burns, the recommendations are slightly higher to account for the increased fluid losses and the need for more aggressive fluid resuscitation.\n\nThe consensus guidelines for burn care, such as those from the American Burn Association, suggest a minimum hourly urine output of 30-50 mL for adult burn patients.
