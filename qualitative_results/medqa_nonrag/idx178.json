    "query": "What other finding will most likely be seen in this patient?\n\nA. Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion\nB. Right-sided Horner's syndrome\nC. Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement\nD. Right-sided analgesia",
    "answer_letter": "D",
    "question_idx": 178,
    "response": "The patient has a left C5 hemicord lesion, which means there is damage to the left side of the spinal cord at the level of the C5 vertebra. The spinal cord is divided into two main parts: the dorsal (posterior) column and the ventral (anterior) column. The ventral column contains the corticospinal tract, which is responsible for motor function, and the dorsal column, which is responsible for sensory function.\n\nGiven that the lesion is on the left side of the spinal cord, the right side of the body will be affected because the spinal cord carries information from the left side of the body to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Therefore, the right side of the body will be affected by the lesion.\n\nA. Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion - This would be expected because the corticospinal tract, which is responsible for voluntary motor control, is located in the ventral column of the spinal cord.\n\nB. Right-sided Horner's syndrome - This is a condition that affects the sympathetic nervous system and would not be expected with a lesion at the C5 level, which is not in the area of the sympathetic chain.\n\nC. Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement - This is not correct because the lesion is on the left side of the spinal cord, and the corticospinal tract is involved on the right side of the body.\n\nD. Right-sided analgesia - This would not be expected because the dorsal column, which is responsible for sensory function, is not affected by this lesion.\n\nThe most likely finding in this patient would be spastic paralysis on the right side of the body, which is the side opposite to the lesion and corresponds to the side of the body that the corticospinal tract innervates.\n\nSo, the answer is A.<|end_of_text|>",

Foot drop is a classic sign of weakness in dorsiflexion of the foot, which indicates a problem with the nerve that innervates the muscles responsible for this action.\n\nThe nerve that is responsible for dorsiflexion of the foot is the common fibular nerve (also known as the common peroneal nerve). This nerve wraps around the neck of the fibula and divides into two branches: the deep fibular nerve, which innervates the muscles responsible for dorsiflexion of the foot, and the superficial fibular nerve, which innervates the muscles responsible for eversion of the foot.\n\nThe common fibular nerve is a branch of the sciatic nerve, which runs just anterior to the piriformis muscle. The location of the pelvic mass as described in the question, compressing a nerve just anterior to the piriformis muscle, would be consistent with compression of the common fibular nerve or the sciatic nerve before it bifurcates into the tibial and common fibular nerves.\n\nThe tibial nerve, obturator nerve, and femoral nerve do not mediate dorsiflexion of the foot and are therefore not the correct answers. The tibial nerve innervates the muscles of the posterior compartment of the leg, which are responsible for plantarflexion and toe flexion. The obturator nerve primarily innervates the adductor muscles of the thigh, and the femoral nerve innervates the muscles of the anterior compartment of the thigh, which are responsible for knee extension.\n\nSo, the answer is A."

PTH is secreted by the parathyroid glands and is responsible for regulating calcium levels in the blood.
