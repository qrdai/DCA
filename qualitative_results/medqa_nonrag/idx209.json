He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. He has worked as a fruit picker for the past 25 years. His current medications include captopril and metformin. Examination of the oral cavity shows a single ulcer near the vermillion border.",
    "query": "Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Squamous cell carcinoma\nB. Aphthous stomatitis\nC. Actinic keratosis\nD. Traumatic ulcer",
    "answer_letter": "A",
    "question_idx": 209,
    "response": "The patient is a 58-year-old white man with a history of smoking and occupational exposure to sunlight (as a fruit picker). The lesion is described as painless and located on the lower lip, which are classic features for actinic keratosis. Actinic keratosis is a precancerous skin condition that is caused by chronic sun exposure and is more common in fair-skinned individuals. It typically presents as a scaly, rough patch on sun-exposed areas such as the face, lips, and hands.\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma (A) is a type of skin cancer that can arise from actinic keratosis, but it is less likely to be the initial diagnosis given the patient's history and the description of the lesion.\n\nAphthous stomatitis (B) is a recurrent oral ulceration that is not related to sun exposure and is typically painful.\n\nTraumatic ulcer (D) could be a possibility, but the patient's history of sun exposure and the location of the lesion on the lower lip make actinic keratosis a more likely diagnosis.\n\nSo, the answer is C.<|end_of_text|>",

Additionally, the differential in blood pressure between the arms is a common finding in aortic dissection due to the involvement of the subclavian arteries. The arrhythmic pulse and the chest X-ray showing a widened mediastinum further support the diagnosis of aortic dissection. A diastolic murmur heard over the right second intercostal space can be associated with aortic regurgitation, which may occur secondary to aortic dissection.\n\nAcute myocardial infarction (A) may present with chest pain but typically does not cause a differential in blood pressure between the arms or a widened mediastinum on X-ray.\n\nPulmonary embolism (B) can cause chest pain and shortness of breath but is not typically associated with a differential in blood pressure between the arms or a widened mediastinum.\n\nPericarditis (D) can cause chest pain that changes with position and may be associated with a pericardial friction rub, but it does not usually cause a differential in blood pressure between the arms or a widened mediastinum.\n\nSo, the answer is C."

Iron deficiency anemia typically presents with microcytic, hypochromic red blood cells and is not usually associated with spherocytes or a high reticulocyte count.\n\nB. G6PD deficiency is a condition that leads to episodic hemolysis in response to oxidative stress, and Heinz bodies would be present upon examination.\n\nC.
