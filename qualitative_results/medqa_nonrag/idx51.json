    "answer_letter": "A",
    "question_idx": 51,
    "response": "The patient's symptoms of progressive fatigue and muscle cramps, along with his elevated blood pressure, are suggestive of a hypertensive crisis. The lab values show a normal sodium level, normal chloride level, low potassium level, and normal bicarbonate level. The BUN is also normal, which suggests that the kidneys are not significantly impaired at this time.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Aldosterone excess would typically lead to hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, which is not the case here.\n\nB. Catecholamine-secreting mass could cause hypertension due to the excess catecholamines, but this would not typically cause hypokalemia.\n\nC. Cortisol excess, or Cushing's syndrome, could cause hypertension and hypokalemia due to the effects of cortisol on the kidneys, leading to potassium wasting.\n\nD. Impaired kidney perfusion could lead to hypertension due to the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), but this would not typically cause hypokalemia.\n\nThe most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension, given the hypokalemia and the absence of other electrolyte abnormalities, is cortisol excess. Cortisol can cause hypokalemia by increasing renal potassium excretion, which is not seen in the other options.\n\nSo, the answer is C.<|end_of_text|>",

The treatment for a subdural hematoma that is causing significant symptoms or brain compression typically involves surgical intervention to evacuate the hematoma.\n\nA. Immediate repeat craniotomy, with careful intraoperative hemodynamic monitoring \u2013 This option would be considered if the patient's condition is deteriorating and there is a need for immediate intervention to relieve pressure on the brain. Intraoperative hemodynamic monitoring is particularly important in this patient due to his history of congestive heart failure.\n\nB. Mannitol infusion, with monitoring for potential cardiac overload \u2013 Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that can help reduce intracranial pressure by drawing fluid out of the brain tissue and into the bloodstream. However, in a patient with congestive heart failure, mannitol could exacerbate heart failure by increasing the volume of fluid that the heart has to pump.\n\nC. Administration of hypertonic saline \u2013 Hypertonic saline works similarly to mannitol in reducing intracranial pressure. It is also an osmotic agent, but it has the advantage of being less likely to cause fluid overload compared to mannitol, making it a potentially safer option in patients with congestive heart failure.\n\nD. High levels of inspired oxygen, adjusted for cardiac function \u2013 While oxygen therapy can support brain tissue that is at risk due to decreased blood flow, it does not directly aid in the resolution of a hematoma or promote brain expansion.\n\nConsidering the patient's history of congestive heart failure, the best option that would promote brain expansion and aid hematoma resolution while also considering the patient's cardiac status is hypertonic saline. It can help reduce intracranial pressure without significantly increasing the risk of cardiac overload.\n\nSo, the answer is C."
