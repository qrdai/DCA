    "context": "A 40-year-old businessman who was previously well is brought into the emergency department by his assistant with a complaint of left-sided weakness after a chiropractic neck manipulation. He has never felt like this before. Past medical history is insignificant. His blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg, pulse 86/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F). A T2-weighted MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. The patient is treated with cervical immobilization, a course of steroids, and physical therapy.\n\nHere are some knowledge points that might be relevant:\n### Knowledge Point 1: <Spinal Cord Injury and Neurological Findings>.\n- Definition: Spinal cord injury can lead to various neurological findings depending on the level and extent of the injury. These findings may include motor deficits, sensory deficits, and autonomic dysfunction. Understanding the specific neurological manifestations associated with spinal cord lesions is crucial for predicting the patient's clinical presentation.\n\n### Knowledge Point 2: <Cervical Spinal Cord Lesions>.\n- Definition: Cervical spinal cord lesions can result in distinct patterns of neurological deficits based on the level of the lesion. Knowledge of the anatomical organization of the spinal cord and the corresponding neurological functions at different levels is essential for predicting the specific deficits that may occur in patients with cervical cord lesions.\n\n### Knowledge Point 3: <Horner's Syndrome>.\n- Definition: Horner's syndrome is a combination of symptoms caused by a disruption of the sympathetic nerve pathway to the eye and face. It typically presents with ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid), miosis (constricted pupil), anhidrosis (lack of sweating), and sometimes enophthalmos (sunken appearance of the eye). Understanding the clinical features and etiology of Horner's syndrome is important for recognizing its presence in patients with relevant neurological conditions.\n\n### Knowledge Point 4: <Corticospinal Tract and Motor Function>.\n- Definition: The corticospinal tract is a major descending motor pathway responsible for voluntary motor control. Understanding the anatomical organization and function of the corticospinal tract is crucial for predicting the motor deficits that may occur in patients with spinal cord lesions affecting this pathway.",
    "query": "What other finding will most likely be seen in this patient?\n\nA. Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion\nB. Right-sided Horner's syndrome\nC. Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement\nD. Right-sided analgesia",
    "answer_letter": "D",
    "question_idx": 178,
    "response": "Given the patient's presentation with left-sided weakness after a cervical manipulation, we can infer that the lesion is likely in the cervical region of the spinal cord. The left-sided weakness suggests that the lesion is on the right side of the spinal cord, as the corticospinal tract decussates at the level of the medulla oblongata, meaning that motor signals from the left side of the brain cross to the right side of the spinal cord to control the left side of the body.\n\nThe presence of a left C5 hemicord lesion indicates that the lesion is affecting the right side of the spinal cord at the level of C5. This level corresponds to the cervical region of the spinal cord, which is responsible for motor control of the upper limbs and diaphragm.\n\nGiven the options provided:\nA. Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion - This is a common finding in spinal cord injuries due to the loss of inhibitory control over the motor neurons, leading to increased muscle tone and spasms.\nB. Right-sided Horner's syndrome - This is not likely because Horner's syndrome is associated with a disruption of the sympathetic pathway, which is not typically affected by a C5 hemicord lesion.\nC. Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement - This is not correct because the corticospinal tract is already crossed at the level of the medulla oblongata, so a lesion at C5 would not affect the contralateral (left) corticospinal tract.\nD. Right-sided analgesia - This is not likely because the C5 level is not typically associated with sensory deficits, and the lesion is described as a hemicord lesion, which would not affect the entire cross-section of the spinal cord.\n\nBased on the information provided and the typical neurological findings associated with cervical spinal cord lesions, the most likely additional finding in this patient would be spastic paralysis at the level of the lesion, which would manifest as increased muscle tone and spasms in the upper limbs and diaphragm.\n\nSo, the answer is A.<|end_of_text|>",
